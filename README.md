# Dr. Hughes Report Template

This template was created specifically for Dr. Hughes's lab reports in his I.T. classes. It uses two folders - images and report. The `addPic` macro extracts images from the images folder using a `section_item` specification. The `labNum` command is used in generating the title and section number headings.
